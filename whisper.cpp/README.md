Stable: [v1.2.1](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/releases/tag/v1.2.1) / [Roadmap | F.A.Q.](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/discussions/126)

High-performance inference of [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) automatic speech recognition (ASR) model:

- Plain C/C++ implementation without dependencies
- Apple silicon first-class citizen - optimized via Arm Neon and Accelerate framework
- AVX intrinsics support for x86 architectures
- VSX intrinsics support for POWER architectures
- Mixed F16 / F32 precision
- Low memory usage (Flash Attention)
- Zero memory allocations at runtime
- Runs on the CPU
- [C-style API](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/whisper.h)

Supported platforms:

- [x] Mac OS (Intel and Arm)
- [x] [iOS](examples/whisper.objc)
- [x] [Android](examples/whisper.android)
- [x] Linux / [FreeBSD](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/56#issuecomment-1350920264)
- [x] [WebAssembly](examples/whisper.wasm)
- [x] Windows ([MSVC](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml#L117-L144) and [MinGW](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/168)]
- [x] [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/discussions/166)

The entire implementation of the model is contained in 2 source files:

- Tensor operations: [ggml.h](ggml.h) / [ggml.c](ggml.c)
- Transformer inference: [whisper.h](whisper.h) / [whisper.cpp](whisper.cpp)

Having such a lightweight implementation of the model allows to easily integrate it in different platforms and applications.
As an example, here is a video of running the model on an iPhone 13 device - fully offline, on-device: [whisper.objc](examples/whisper.objc)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/197385372-962a6dea-bca1-4d50-bf96-1d8c27b98c81.mp4

You can also easily make your own offline voice assistant application: [command](examples/command)

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/204038393-2f846eae-c255-4099-a76d-5735c25c49da.mp4

Or you can even run it straight in the browser: [talk.wasm](examples/talk.wasm)

## Implementation details

- The core tensor operations are implemented in C ([ggml.h](ggml.h) / [ggml.c](ggml.c))
- The transformer model and the high-level C-style API are implemented in C++ ([whisper.h](whisper.h) / [whisper.cpp](whisper.cpp))
- Sample usage is demonstrated in [main.cpp](examples/main)
- Sample real-time audio transcription from the microphone is demonstrated in [stream.cpp](examples/stream)
- Various other examples are available in the [examples](examples) folder

The tensor operators are optimized heavily for Apple silicon CPUs. Depending on the computation size, Arm Neon SIMD
instrisics or CBLAS Accelerate framework routines are used. The latter are especially effective for bigger sizes since
the Accelerate framework utilizes the special-purpose AMX coprocessor available in modern Apple products.

## Quick start

First, download one of the Whisper models converted in [ggml format](models). For example:

```bash
bash ./models/download-ggml-model.sh base.en
```

Now build the [main](examples/main) example and transcribe an audio file like this:

```bash
# build the main example
make

# transcribe an audio file
./main -f samples/jfk.wav
```

---

For a quick demo, simply run `make base.en`:

```java
$ make base.en

The command downloads the `base.en` model converted to custom `ggml` format and runs the inference on all `.wav` samples in the folder `samples`.

For detailed usage instructions, run: `./main -h`

Note that the [main](examples/main) example currently runs only with 16-bit WAV files, so make sure to convert your input before running the tool.
For example, you can use `ffmpeg` like this:

```java
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav
```

## More audio samples

If you want some extra audio samples to play with, simply run:

```
make samples
```

This will download a few more audio files from Wikipedia and convert them to 16-bit WAV format via `ffmpeg`.

You can download and run the other models as follows:

```
make tiny.en
make tiny
make base.en
make base
make small.en
make small
make medium.en
make medium
make large-v1
make large
```

| large  | 2.9 GB | ~3.3 GB | `0f4c8e34f21cf1a914c59d8b3ce882345ad349d6` |

## Limitations

- Inference only
- No GPU support (yet)

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   My fellow Americans, this day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   At nine o'clock this morning, Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our Space Shuttle Columbia.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   A short time later, debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   The Columbia's lost. There are no survivors.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   On board was a crew of seven.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Colonel Rick Husband, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Anderson, Commander Laurel Clark,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Captain David Brown, Commander William McCool, Dr. Kultna Shavla, and Ilan Ramon,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   a colonel in the Israeli Air Force.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   These men and women assumed great risk in the service to all humanity.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   In an age when space flight has come to seem almost routine,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   it is easy to overlook the dangers of travel by rocket
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   and the difficulties of navigating the fierce outer atmosphere of the Earth.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   These astronauts knew the dangers, and they faced them willingly,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   knowing they had a high and noble purpose in life.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Because of their courage and daring and idealism, we will miss them all the more.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   All Americans today are thinking as well of the families of these men and women
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   who have been given this sudden shock and grief.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   You're not alone. Our entire nation grieves with you,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   and those you love will always have the respect and gratitude of this country.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The cause in which they died will continue.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Mankind is led into the darkness beyond our world by the inspiration of discovery
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and the longing to understand. Our journey into space will go on.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   In the skies today, we saw destruction and tragedy.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Yet farther than we can see, there is comfort and hope.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   In the words of the prophet Isaiah, "Lift your eyes and look to the heavens
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   who created all these. He who brings out the starry hosts one by one
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   and calls them each by name."
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   The same Creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   The crew of the shuttle Columbia did not return safely to earth,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   yet we can pray that all are safely home.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   May God bless the grieving families, and may God continue to bless America.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   [Silence]

## Real-time audio input example

This is a naive example of performing real-time inference on audio from your microphone.
The [stream](examples/stream) tool samples the audio every half a second and runs the transcription continously.
More info is available in [issue #10](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/10).

```java
make stream
./stream -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -t 8 --step 500 --length 5000
```

## Confidence color-coding

Adding the `--print-colors` argument will print the transcribed text using an experimental color coding strategy
to highlight words with high or low confidence:

<img width="965" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/197356445-311c8643-9397-4e5e-b46e-0b4b4daa2530.png">

## Controlling the length of the generated text segments (experimental)

For example, to limit the line length to a maximum of 16 characters, simply add `-ml 16`:

```java
./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/jfk.wav -ml 16

whisper_model_load: loading model from './models/ggml-base.en.bin'
...
system_info: n_threads = 4 / 10 | AVX2 = 0 | AVX512 = 0 | NEON = 1 | FP16_VA = 1 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 1 |

main: processing './samples/jfk.wav' (176000 samples, 11.0 sec), 4 threads, 1 processors, lang = en, task = transcribe, timestamps = 1 ...

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850]   And so my
[00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.590]   fellow
[00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.140]   Americans, ask
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.660]   not what your
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.840]   country can do
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.430]   for you, ask
[00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.440]   what you can do
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.020]   for your
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.000]   country.
```

## Word-level timestamp

The `--max-len` argument can be used to obtain word-level timestamps. Simply use `-ml 1`:

```java
./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/jfk.wav -ml 1

whisper_model_load: loading model from './models/ggml-base.en.bin'
...
system_info: n_threads = 4 / 10 | AVX2 = 0 | AVX512 = 0 | NEON = 1 | FP16_VA = 1 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 1 |

main: processing './samples/jfk.wav' (176000 samples, 11.0 sec), 4 threads, 1 processors, lang = en, task = transcribe, timestamps = 1 ...

[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320]  
[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.370]   And
[00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.690]   so
[00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:00.850]   my
[00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.590]   fellow
[00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.850]   Americans
[00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.300]  ,
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.140]   ask
[00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.990]   not
[00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.410]   what
[00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.660]   your
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.260]   country
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.600]   can

## Karaoke-style movie generation (experimental)

The [main](examples/main) example provides support for output of karaoke-style movies, where the
currently pronounced word is highlighted. Use the `-wts` argument and run the generated bash script.
This requires to have `ffmpeg` installed.

Here are a few *"typical"* examples:

```java
./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/jfk.wav -owts
source ./samples/jfk.wav.wts
ffplay ./samples/jfk.wav.mp4
```

---

```java
./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/mm0.wav -owts
source ./samples/mm0.wav.wts
ffplay ./samples/mm0.wav.mp4
```

---

```java
./main -m ./models/ggml-base.en.bin -f ./samples/gb0.wav -owts
source ./samples/gb0.wav.wts
ffplay ./samples/gb0.wav.mp4
```

## Benchmarks

In order to have an objective comparison of the performance of the inference across different system configurations,
use the [bench](examples/bench) tool. The tool simply runs the Encoder part of the model and prints how much time it
took to execute it. The results are summarized in the following Github issue:

[Benchmark results](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/89)

## ggml format

The original models are converted to a custom binary format. This allows to pack everything needed into a single file:

- model parameters
- mel filters
- vocabulary
- weights

You can download the converted models using the [models/download-ggml-model.sh](models/download-ggml-model.sh) script
or manually from here:

- https://huggingface.co/datasets/ggerganov/whisper.cpp
- https://ggml.ggerganov.com

For more details, see the conversion script [models/convert-pt-to-ggml.py](models/convert-pt-to-ggml.py) or the README
in [models](models).
